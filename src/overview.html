<p>EasyPVA (Easy PVAccess) is a software library that provides to an EPICS client programmer, a friendly
client side programming interface to the data of an EPICS based control system. It is intended 
for such uses as rapid development of ad hoc programs by controls engineers, or to provide
scientists a way to directly develop analytical applications.</p>

<p>Specifically, easyPVA provides an easy interface for pvAccess, which is the
software support for high speed controls network communications used in EPICS version 4.
PvAccess provides a callback based interface, which can be hard to use.
EasyPVA provides an interface that does not require callbacks even for monitors.

<p>
EasyChannel provides many "convenience" methods to directly get and put
scalar and scalarArray data types.
Additional methods provide access to the full features of pvAccess.
</p>
<p>
EasyMultiChannel provides access to data from multiple channels as long
as eacxh channel has a top level field named <b>value</b>.
EasyMultiChannel provides two ways to access data from multiple channels:
The first is as an NTMultiChannel. The second is as a double array.
The double array can be used if the value field of every channel is a numeric scalar.
There is code for NTMultiChannel that helps with access to more complicated data types.
